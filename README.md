## MIXMATE

MixMate is an application made to simplify the process of at-home cocktail-making. The app enables the user to create and save cocktail recipes, manage inventory, and determine which cocktails can be made with the ingredients the user has in stock. In addition, MixMate includes a database of cocktails from the International Bartender's Association (IBA) which the user can search and filter through to discover new recipes.
